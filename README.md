This a simple console application which allows you to encode and decode your text message from the standart input or from the file. It uses two algorithms. The first one 
moves every character in the message to the specified number. The second one shifts every English character (from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z') by the specified number 
according to its order in the alphabet. If it reachs the end of the alphabet, it starts back at the beginning (a follows z).
